Practical Malware Analysis and Triage - Coursework

This repository was created as a response to the 'Course Final' section of the Practical Malware Analysis and Triage course created by @huskyhacks. 
The files 'wannahusky.pdf' and 'wannahusky.docx' are the same file, just with different extensions. Both are the report for the 'wannaHusky' ransomware sample included in the course. 
The file 'wannahusky.yara' is a Yara rule that attempts to locate the ransomware sample.
